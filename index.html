    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>This is a webpage showcasing some HTML elements.</h2>
    <h3>Sit back and <s>enjoy</s> the show.</h3>
    <h4>It's about to get bumpy.</h4>
    <h5>No really, it's probably going to be a train wreck.</h5>
    <h1>First thing's first! My paragraph on what semantic elements are:</h1>
    <p>"As the websites “An Overview of HTML5 Semantics” and “HTML5 Semantic Elements” have stated, semantic elements can be summarized as communicating it’s meaning to both the browser and developer. Key factors in why it’s important to use semantic elements over non-semantic elements are that it creates simplicity. With either div or span being replaced by the alternatives such as form, table, or img, the content of the webpage is now described more in detail. Other programmers will be able to differentiate between what is meant to be a header, footer, navigation bar, etc. Rather than using obscure tags without much information, using semantics will vastly improve information and what webpages are trying to convey – it creates specificity, which allows for more accessibility and will also save time in the long run."

    <h1>Now, on to the other stuff!</h1>
    <p>I really think that web development is <strong>interesting.</strong></p>
    <p>Though currently, I'm <em>doubting</em> my skills.<p>
    <p>Here are some of the reasons why I love web development:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creating something from scratch by using coding is <u>incredible!</u></li>
      <li>Watching a project come to life is pretty fascinating.</li>
      <li>I can't wait for my skills to develop in this class.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Okay. So that was an ordered list, how about one where it's just bullet points?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>There could be 100 people in the room.</li>
      <li>99 of those people don't believe in you.</li>
      <li>But all it takes is that 1 person who does believe in you.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So what else can I tell you about me?</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Well, I've recently been playing a lot of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate...</li>
      <li>Richter is probably my favorite character at the moment:</li>
    </ul>

      <li>But <small>secretly</small>, I also love using Isabelle. Just look at that face:</li>
    </ul>
